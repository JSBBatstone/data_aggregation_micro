# Data Aggregation Microservice

## Description

Recruiting Challenge for backend developer

## Assumptions/Notes

1. **Data Capture**  
   - Data capture began at an arbitrary date/time, with no legacy data imported.  
   - As a result, some users may request payouts or spend SCR without having earned it, potentially resulting in a negative balance.

2. **Payout Processing**  
   - Payout requests are processed instantly with 100% accuracy, simulating a perfect banking system.

3. **Inflation**  
   - Inflation will affect the game economy in the future, meaning the current exchange rate of **1 SCR = 1 EUR** is subject to change.

4. **Currency Format**  
   - **Payout Amount**: Denoted in scores (SCR).  
   - **Paid Out**: Denoted in euros (EUR).

5. **API Request Limitations**  
   - Pre-condition specifies:  
     - Maximum of **5 requests per minute**.  
     - Each request can retrieve up to **1000 transactions**.

6. **Transaction Volume**  
   - The system assumes there are no more than **5000 transactions per minute**.

7. **Testing Database**  
   - The DevOps team indicated that it is not possible to spin up a new database specifically for running tests.

8. **Environment Variables**  
   - Due to a modification in GitHub's source code (allegedly), only people with the repository link can view the `.env` file, even in a public repository.

## Installation
